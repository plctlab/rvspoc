      <description>Natural voice interaction is an important form of human-machine interfacing. However, as high-precision ASR models are computationally intensive, these computation projects are usually run on the cloud, worsening the experience. This challenge aims to port high-precision streaming ASR to Sophgo&amp;rsquo;s SG2002 processor. You may choose between Chinese and English models. The goal is to achieve minimum word error rate whilst running on limited RAM (256MBytes) and a rate of RTF&amp;lt;1. You may reference Kaldi, Wenet, and other open source speech recognition projects for your port.</description>

      <description>Improve OpenCV performance on Milk-V Duo. The participant must port OpenCV to the Milk-V Duo platform, optimising its performance. The assessment rubrics will focus on both accuracy and performance: accuracy will be benchmarked using OpenCV&amp;rsquo;s regression testsuites (build/bin/opencv_test_&lt;em&gt;); performance will be assessed using OpenCV&amp;rsquo;s performance testsuites (build/bin/opencv_perf_&lt;/em&gt;). The host will judge based on both the pass rates of regression testsuites and performance metrics and assign scores to each submission based on a predetermined weighted scale.</description>

      <description>Background The RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship is jointly hosted by the PLCT Lab and SOPHGO. Today, RISC-V enjoys a sizeable open source software ecosystem with adequate functionalities, but it lacks optimisation as compared to x86 and ARM64. To help attract developers to the RISC-V ecosystem and to accelerate the advancement of its software ecosystem, the PLCT Lab and SOPHGO jointly launched the &amp;ldquo;RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship.&amp;rdquo; This championship sets its focus on desktop and server software ecosystems, designing competitive categories for compilers, runtime environments, AI software stacks, etc.</description>
