Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Suddenly, Lily's favorite toy fell on the ground. She was very sad and started to cry.
Her mommy asked, "What happened, Lily?"
"My toy fell on the ground and now it's gone," Lily said.
"Don't worry, we'll find it," her mommy said. They looked around the park, but they couldn't find the toy. Then, they saw a boy playing with a toy that looked just like Lily's. It was a gifted toy!
Lily was so happy to have her toy back, but she knew it wasn't hers to keep. She said, "That's stupid! I want it back." Her mommy smiled and said, "I'm glad you found it, Lily. Let's go get it back." And they went home, happy and relieved.
