Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Suddenly, Lily's toy fell out of her pocket. She looked everywhere for it but couldn't find it.
Lily's mommy told her not to worry and that they would get her a new toy. But then, a boy came over and said he saw the toy in the sandbox. He had taken it! Lily's mommy knew how to get it back, so she called the police.
The police came and found the boy who had stolen Lily's toy. They returned it to her, but the boy was very scared and ran away. Lily's mommy explained to her that stealing is wrong and that it's important to always ask before taking something that belongs to someone else.
