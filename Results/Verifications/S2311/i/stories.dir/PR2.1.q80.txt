Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Then, they sat down on a bench to rest.
Lily's mommy had a secret treasure that she wanted to share with Lily. She said, "Lily, look what I found at the park. It's a secret treasure!" Lily was so happy and said, "Wow, mommy! That's a popular treasure! I'll share it with you!"
They sat on the bench and ate the treasure. It was the most delicious treat they had ever tasted. Lily said, "This is the best day ever! I can't wait to tell my friends about it!"
