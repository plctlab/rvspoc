Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Then, they sat down on a bench to rest. 
Lily's mommy had a glass of water nearby. She wanted to pour some water into a cup to drink. But the cup was wet! It had a leak in it. 
Lily's mommy said, "Oh no! We need to dry the glass before we can have our drink." So they used some towels to dry the glass. After that, they drank the water and had a picnic. They laughed and played until it was time to go home.achieved tok/s: 4.618055
