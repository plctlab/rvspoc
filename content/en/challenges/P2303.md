## Program Description

ROCm is an open source compute framework from AMD, which is an NVIDIA's CUDA competitor. This program asks the participant to port ROCm to an arbitrary SG2042/Pioneer Box + AMD GPU platform, making it possible to perform high-performance heterogenous computing on RISC-V hardware with a combination of open source hardware and software.

## Rubrics

1. Supports the ROCm OpenCL runtime and FFT, BLAS, SPARSE, and other mathematics libraries.
2. Test pass rates close to the x86 architecture.
3. Completes ROCm's bundled benchmarks (such as rocm_bandwidth_test, rocHPL, and rocHPCG) and runs common scientific compute applications based on ROCm.

**Assessment Platform: SG2042**
