## Program Description

Port Xv6 to Milk-V Duo, with the ability to interact via serial connection, support for basic peripherals, and the ability to compile sample system and peripheral applications.

## Rubrics

1. Runs basic Xv6 on Milk-V with support for standard features, such as interrupt processing and UART communication.
2. Supports basic peripheral drivers, such as UART, GPIO, I2C, SPI, ADC, and PWM; implement sample applications for each.
3. (Extra Credit) Supports the mailbox driver; implement sample communication application with the big cores.

**Assessment Platform: Duo**
