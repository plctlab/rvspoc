## Program Description

Implement bugfixes and optimization on upstream Node.js for RISC-V, as well as platform-specific optimizations for SG2042/Pioneer Box, optimising benchmark results as much as possible.

## Rubrics

1. Use the benchmark testsuite in Node.js's source tree as the basis for benchmarking, profiling, and optimization.
2. Produce benchmark run results on Node.js v20.10.0, comparing and analysing said results against at least one mainstream platform (ARM64/x86_64) running the same Node.js version.
3. Demo optimization results using node-benchmark-compare.
4. Final results will be assessed in the form of (1) test analysis report, (2) number of testcases successfully optimised, (3) optimization delta of each testcase, and (4) overall optimization delta.

**Assessment Platform: SG2042**
