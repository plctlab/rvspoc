## Program Description

Implement bugfixes and optimisation on upstream Node.js for RISC-V, as well as platform-specific optimisations for SG2042/Pioneer Box, optimising benchmark results as much as possible.

## Rubrics

1. Use the benchmark testsuite in Node.js's source tree as the basis for benchmarking, profiling, and optimisation.
2. Produce benchmark run results on Node.js v20.10.0, comparing and analysing said results against at least one mainstream platform (ARM64/x86_64) running the same Node.js version.
3. Demo optimisation results using node-benchmark-compare.
4. Final results will be assessed in the form of (1) test analysis report, (2) number of testcases successfully optimised, (3) optimisation delta of each testcase, and (4) overall optimisation delta.

**Assessment Platform: SG2042**
