## Program Description

Port Zephyr to Milk-V Duo, with the ability to interact via serial connection, support for basic peripherals, and the ability to compile sample system and peripheral applications.

## Rubrics

1. Runs basic Zephyr features on Milk-V Duo with support for standard features, such as interrupt processing, task switching, and UART communication.
2. Supports basic peripheral drivers, such as UART, GPIO, I2C, SPI, ADC, and PWM; implement sample applications for each.
3. Supports the mailbox driver; implement sample communication application with the big cores.
4. (Extra Credit) Supports camera (GC2083 recommended).
5. (Extra Credit) Interaction with the big cores using openamp/rpmsg-lite.

**Assessment Platform: Duo**
