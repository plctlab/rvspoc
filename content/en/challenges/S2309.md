## Program Description

Improve OpenCV performance on Milk-V Duo. The participant must port OpenCV to the Milk-V Duo platform, optimising its performance. The assessment rubrics will focus on both accuracy and performance: accuracy will be benchmarked using OpenCV's regression testsuites (build/bin/opencv\_test\_\*); performance will be assessed using OpenCV's performance testsuites (build/bin/opencv\_perf_\*). The host will judge based on both the pass rates of regression testsuites and performance metrics, calculated in a pre-determined weighted score scale.

## Rubrics

1. Passes regression testsuites on all OpenCV modules (build/bin/opencv_test_\*).
2. Passes perfromance testsuites on all OpenCV modules (build/bin/opencv_perf_\*).
3. The host will judge based on both the pass rates of regression testsuites and performance metrics and assign scores to each submission based on a predetermined weighted scale. The highest scoring submission wins.

**Assessment Platform: Duo**
