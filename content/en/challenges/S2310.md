## Program Description

ncnn is a high-performance neural network compute framework with good RISC-V support. This program assesses the participant's ability to maximise ncnn performance on a Duo, as benchmarked by its internal performance testsuites.

## Rubrics

1. Does not produce new failures in regression testing.
2. Makes use of RVV0.7, the TPU, and other compute components available on the Duo.
3. Runs as many benchmark models as possible, noting time elapsed for each.

**Assessment Platform: Duo**
