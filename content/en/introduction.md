## Background

The RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship is jointly hosted by the PLCT Lab and SOPHGO. Today, RISC-V enjoys a sizeable open source software ecosystem with adequate functionalities, but it lacks optimisation as compared to x86 and ARM64. To help attract developers to the RISC-V ecosystem and to accelerate the advancement of its software ecosystem, the PLCT Lab and SOPHGO jointly launched the "RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship." This championship sets its focus on desktop and server software ecosystems, designing competitive categories for compilers, runtime environments, AI software stacks, etc. and is open to participation by developers around the globe with prizes available for successful contestants.

## Assessment Environments

All results must be verified on at least one of the following RISC-V hardware environments, except the results of challenge S2312, which should be verified on SG2002:

- SG2042/Pioneer Box (SG2042)
- CV1800B/Milk-V Duo (Duo)

## Notes on Programs

- Competition programs will be announced gradually from November 27th to December 31st. We welcome feedback and ideas from developers from around the globe and will design and adjust competition programs accordingly. Let's make RISC-V's software ecosystem better together.
- Any requests for clarification should be directed to [the host staff](mailto:rvspoc@cyberlimes.cn), who will make adjustments and provided clarifications as needed.
- The host will maintain a list of parts and models for the Chinese domestic GPUs, which will be updated continually until December 31st.
- Assessment for all program results will be done in collaboration with core developers from open sources communities, experts from the PLCT Lab, and experts from our sponsors. We will announce assessment committees for each program by December 31st.
